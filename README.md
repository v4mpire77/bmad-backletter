# Blackletter - Contract Analysis Platform

## üéØ **CURRENT STATUS: MVP CORE COMPLETE!** 

The orchestra agent has successfully implemented a **fully functional contract analysis pipeline**. The foundation is solid and ready for the next phase of development.

## üöÄ **What's Working Right Now**

‚úÖ **Complete Backend Pipeline**
- File upload & job orchestration (PDF/DOCX support)
- Text extraction with sentence indexing
- GDPR Article 28 detection engine
- Evidence window building
- Findings persistence & storage

‚úÖ **Production Ready Services**
- FastAPI application with CORS & logging
- Background task processing
- Rulepack loading & validation
- Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)

## üìã **Quick Start**

### Backend (Ready to Run)

Run the setup script to create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh                         # macOS/Linux
# or
pwsh -NoProfile -File tools/windows/setup.ps1  # Windows PowerShell
```

Then start the API:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate     # Windows: .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
uvicorn blackletter_api.main:app --reload --app-dir apps/api
```

On Windows you can start the API and/or frontend with a helper script:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File tools/windows/dev.ps1      # run API and web
pwsh -NoProfile -File tools/windows/dev.ps1 -Api # API only
pwsh -NoProfile -File tools/windows/dev.ps1 -Web # web only
```

> **Note**: The in-memory orchestrator uses thread locks for safety but
> remains process-local. Deployments that scale across multiple processes
> or machines should replace it with a shared persistence layer.

### Frontend (Ready for Development)
```bash
cd apps/web
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

> **Note**: These commands assume a `pnpm-workspace.yaml` exists at the repository root to enable pnpm workspace features.

### Enhanced Environment Setup

The platform now supports enhanced async processing with Celery workers and Supabase integration. Key environment variables:

#### Required for Async Processing
```bash
# Celery Configuration (integrated from v4mpire77/blackletter)
CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND=redis://localhost:6379/0
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0

# API Security
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here-replace-in-production
```

#### Optional Supabase Integration
```bash
# Supabase Database (when using Docker Compose)
SUPABASE_URL=http://localhost:54322
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
GOTRUE_JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret-replace-in-production
```

#### Starting the Celery Worker

For background processing of contract analysis jobs:

```bash
# Start the Celery worker (Unix/Linux/macOS)
source .venv/bin/activate
celery -A blackletter_api.services.celery_app:celery_app worker --loglevel=info

# Start with Docker Compose (includes Redis, Supabase, and all services)
docker-compose up celery redis supabase-db
```

On Windows PowerShell:
```powershell
# Activate virtual environment
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Start Celery worker
celery -A blackletter_api.services.celery_app:celery_app worker --loglevel=info
```

### Demo Mode

To run the UI without a backend, enable mock data by setting `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCKS=1` in your environment. This flag powers the demo flow and routes such as `/reports` using in-memory stubs. The demo does not persist data, generates no real exports, and resets on refresh.

## Development

### Workspace setup

This repository uses a [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) workspace defined in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` with packages under `apps/*` and `packages/*`. The root `pnpm-lock.yaml` tracks dependency versions and all scripts should be invoked with `pnpm` from the repo root.

Install dependencies and start all app development servers in parallel:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Common scripts can be run from the repo root:

```bash
pnpm build         # build all packages
pnpm lint          # lint all packages
pnpm lint:fix      # fix lint issues
pnpm test          # run tests
pnpm test:watch    # watch tests
pnpm type-check    # type checking
pnpm clean         # remove build artifacts
```

These commands work in Windows PowerShell and Unix shells.

### BMAD development method

The repository no longer vendors the BMAD framework source. To set up the
AI‚Äëassisted workflow, install the method into your workspace:

```bash
npx bmad-method-install
```

This command copies the required `.bmad-core` configuration without adding the
entire framework to your project tree.

### Development Tools

**Cleanup Script**

The repository includes a `cleanup.sh` script to archive and untrack vendor directories and other non-essential files. This helps keep the repository clean and focused. To run it:

```bash
./cleanup.sh
```

### POSIX setup

The repository provides a helper script for macOS and Linux environments that mirrors the Windows setup.

```bash
./scripts/setup_posix.sh
source .venv/bin/activate
uvicorn blackletter_api.main:app --reload --app-dir apps/api
```

Optional flags:

- `--recreate-venv` rebuilds the virtual environment
- `--skip-install` skips installing dependencies

## üéØ **Next Development Priorities**

### Ready to Start (Epic 2 Completion)
1. **Weak Language Lexicon Enhancement** - Expand detection capabilities
2. **Token Ledger Caps** - Implement usage tracking & limits
3. **Findings Table Frontend** - Build React components for results display

### Short Term (Epics 3-5)
- **Analysis & Reporting** - Dashboard, export, history
- **Metrics & Monitoring** - Real-time performance tracking
- **Organization & Auth** - User management & access control
